                | It was developed as part of the course Web Application Development (CSCI3230U)
                | at UOIT (University of Ontario Institute of Technology) in Winter 2019.
                | Since living is a very large part of studying on campus,
                | the idea came up to simplify the organization with a web application. Have fun with HORGANIZE!
                | Meet our Developers below."
