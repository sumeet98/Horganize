                    Food-Shopping for a full stomach is a central topic in a flat-sharing community.
                    But what was missing in the fridge again? So that you don't forget anything, 
                    HORGANIZE comes with a flat-wide shopping list.
                    As soon as an item has been purchased, it can be removed from the list so that it is not bought twice.
                    Keeping track can be so easy!

                    If several people live together, it is important to know the other people's schedule. 
                    A parent's visit to a flatmate doesn't get along so well with your house party, right?
                    To avoid this, HORGANIZE comes with a room-wide calendar to keep track of all appointments. 
                    View or add events of the month, week or day at one glance.

                <p class="featureParagraph">
                    When it comes to shared living and shopping, it is common to split expenses. 
                    The weekly shopping trip or the rent for the apartment must be divided fairly among all flatmates.
                    Therefore, Horganize comes with an interactive wallet that easily displays expenses and debts.
